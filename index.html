      <h1>I'd Love to Take a Vacation To Barcelona</h1>
      <P>
        Barcelona features beautiful beaches, architecture by Antoni Gaud√≠, and is home to the Barca Blaugranes.

        <ul class="card-text">
          <li>I think Barcelona and the Spanish national team have been good for soccer because there are a lot of teams
            that come up
            playing from the back: with the goalie, the defense, moving up a defender to midfield, playing attacking
            soccer. I think
            fans want to see that. They want to see beautiful soccer, a spectacle, and Barcelona does that. --Xavi</li>
          <li class="bg-success">When I arrived at Barcelona, I was following a dream, but I now realize sometimes it's
            better to be
            content with what
            you have rather than follow a dream which nearly kills you. --Zlatan
            Ibrahimovic</li>
          <li>Barcelona players know how to summon up Messi into the game, letting him rest in periods of the match and
            then using his
            services at vital moments when he shows up in the middle of the pitch to create his magical plays. --Rivaldo
